# DataTraining

This is an ML model for recognizing handwritten digits.

The adopted library for building the model is OpenCV.

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a set of 60000 images of handwritten digits from 0-9 and coresponding labels.

The adopted architecture was the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and for data training the backpropagation algorithm was selected.
